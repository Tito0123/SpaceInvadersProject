# Overview

This project is a version of the space invaders created by Tomohiro Nishikado for Taito. Our version is an adaptation of Michael Son’s Mbed Space Invaders. Michael Son’s Space Invaders is the foundation upon which we built our game, and the features we implemented to make our game unique are listed below:


1. Joystick/IMU: Micheal Son's game makes use of a navigation switch to browse through the game menu and control the ship. Our version of the game uses both a joystic and an IMU for smoother movement and a more comfortable feel. Clicking the joystick also changes the color of the player.
2. Pushbutton: In both version of the game, a pushbutton is used to select an option on the menu screen and shoot missles at the rows of enemies.
3. Speakers: Our version of the game utilizes a speaker and a class D amplifier to play sounds that are in sync with the game (some examples include: victory/losing sound, game menu sound, missle fired sound e.t.c). This feature is not present in Micheal Son's game.
4. Levels: In the first level, the player has three lives; in the second level, the player has two lives, and in the third level, the player   has one life.
5. LED lighting effect: These effects are triggered once the game starts (i.e., at the game menu screen), when the player fires a shot, during a victory e.t.c  
6. Barriers: four barriers shields the player from the enemy missiles. These barriers break down once they have been hit by a missile or by the player.
7. Best Time: This version of space invaders also keeps track of the best time i.e., the fastest time in which the game is completed.
8. Potentiometer: Used to control the volume of the speaker.
