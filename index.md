# Overview

This project is a version of the Nokia space invaders with the following features:
1. Joystick/IMU: used to browse through the game menu and control the ship. Clicking the joystick also changes the color of the player.
2. Pushbutton: used to select an option on the menu screen and shoot sprites at the rows of enemies.
3. Speakers: plays music that is in sync with the game (some examples include: victory/losing sound, game menu sound, sprite fired sound e.t.c)
4. Levels: In the first level, the player has three lives; in the second level, the player has two lives, and in the third level, the player   has one life.
5. LED lighting effect: These effects are triggered once the game starts (i.e., at the game menu screen), when the player fires a shot, during a victory e.t.c  
6. Barriers: four barriers shields the player from the enemy missiles. These barriers break down once they have been hit by a missile or by the player.
7. Best Time: This version of space invaders also keeps track of the best time i.e., the fastest time in which the game is completed.
8. Potentiometer: Used to control the volume of the speaker.
