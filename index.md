# Overview

This project is a version of the well-known retro arcade game, Space Invaders, that was developed by Tomohiro Nishikado for Taito in 1978. We thought that it would be interesting to produce this game with the ARM Mbed and the I/O hardware that is available in the ECE 4180 kits and in the ECE 4180 lab. We searched the Mbed wiki pages and found that Michael Son had already implemented a basic version of Mbed Space Invaders. Instead of simply building a new version of Space Invaders for the Mbed from scratch, we decided to adapt and improve upon Michel Son's Mbed Space Invaders. Michael Son's Mbed Space Invaders lacked the documentation necessary to reproduce the audio files that were initially required for his version of the game to run, and his version was somewhat buggy with frequent crashing and freezing. He neglected to use the "volatile" keyword that is used by the Mbed cloud compiler for mutual exclusion with global variables, and he often used the wait() function (that locks up the processor) when the Thread::wait() function (that allows other threads to run while one thread waits) should have been used. Michael Son's version also used basic squares (drawn with uLCD.filled_rectangle()) for the player and enemies instead of sprites, and his game menu had only one option (to start the game) and did not allow for cursor movement. The score in his version was calculated such that any winner of the game would have the same score; the score was based only on the number of enemies defeated. His game also lacked the barriers that the player could hide behind in the original game (until the player's or enemies' missiles destroyed them). The controls for Michel Son's version consisted of only a pushbutton and a somewhat uncomfortable 5-way tactile switch that allowed for only one speed of movement to the left or right. However, his game did offer a good foundation for the basic mechanics of the Space Invaders game. Michael Sonâ€™s Space Invaders is the foundation upon which we built our game, and the features we implemented to make our game unique are listed below:


1. Joystick/IMU: Micheal Son's game uses a navigation switch to browse through the game menu and control the ship. Our version of the game uses both a joystick and an IMU for smoother movement and a more comfortable feel. Clicking the joystick also changes the color of the player. The link to the joystick can be found in the References/Citation Section.
2. Pushbutton: Both versions of the game use a pushbutton to select an option on the menu screen and shoot missiles at the rows of enemies.
3. Speakers: Our version of the game utilizes a speaker and a class D amplifier to play sounds that are in sync with the game (e.g., victory/losing sound, game menu sound, missile fired sound, e.t.c). This feature is not present in Micheal Son's game. The links to the sounds we used are in the References/Citation section. Finally, It is also important to note that while recreating our version, the sound files (.wave files) need to be saved in a folder called "wavfiles," which should be stored on the SD card.
4. Barriers: To make our game more complex, we added barriers to shield the player. These barriers will break down when they are hit by the enemy or player missiles. This feature was not originally included in Micheal Son's game.
5. Levels: Our game has three levels. The game becomes more difficult as the player proceeds to the next level. The number of barriers present in the game reduces, the missiles are shot at an increased speed, and the number of lives reduces. On the other hand, Michel Son's game had one level without any of the features mentioned above. 
6. LED lighting effect: These effects are triggered once the game starts (i.e., at the game menu screen), when the player fires a shot, during a victory e.t.c. Again, this is another feature that makes our version different from Michael Son's.
7. High Score: Since Michael Son's game had one level, the high score was always the same, regardless of how fast the player finished the game. Our version uses a more realistic and complex method of computing the score. We achieved this by subtracting the time duration of the game from the product of the usual score calculation (implemented in Michael Son's game)and the game level. This method makes sure that the difficulty of the level and time duration are taken into account when determining the score. A "highscore.txt" file will need to be created and stored on the SD card to recreate this method.
8. Enemy/Player Sprite: Michael Son's game utilizes the rectangle member function of the uLCD class to create the enemy and player sprites. Our version implements a more realistic-looking enemy and player sprite that closely resembles that of the original game created by Tomohiro Nishikado. 
9. Potentiometer: This is used to control the volume of the speaker.

Michael Son's Mbed Space Invaders inspired our version of the game. The link to his wiki page can be found in the References/Citation section.

# Future Improvements
1. When we set out to recreate this game, we wanted to implement a two-player Space Invaders game using two mbeds, two screens, e.t.c. However, we quickly ran into some technical difficulties while attempting to form a means of communication between the two mbeds. We eventually figured it out, but time would not allow us to proceed on this path. Currently, the two mbeds can communicate with each other, and we have the primitives for this setup commented out in our code. In the future, we will move forward with our idea of two players competing to get the highest scores.
2. More work needs to be done to make both versions of the game less buggy.
3. We can further improve the animations of the game and the sound quality.
